## How to Compare Two Visits

2. Use the first dropdown to select the first visit you want to compare
3. Use the second dropdown to select the second visit for comparison
4. Click the "ðŸ“Š Compare Selected Visits" button
5. The comparison will be displayed, showing changes between the two visits

## What the Comparison Shows

The comparison includes:

- Visualizations of the changes
- AI-generated clinical assessment of the changes

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the comparison feature:

1. Make sure you have selected two different visits
2. Check that the visits have complete feature data
3. Try refreshing the page if the comparison doesn't load properly
4. If you see HTML/CSS code instead of formatted tables, try clearing your browser cache

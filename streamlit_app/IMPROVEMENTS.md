# Alzheimer's Diagnosis System Improvements

## MRI Module Enhancements

1. **Fix for Import Error**: Resolved the critical import error in `doctor_view.py` by updating imports to use Hugging Face model for MRI processing.

2. **Real MRI Processing Results**: 
   - Enhanced the Hugging Face model integration to provide real attention maps and visualizations
   - Added comprehensive ROI measurements extraction for brain regions
   - Implemented collection of processed MRI data for future model retraining

3. **Improved Result Persistence**:
   - Added structured storage for processed MRI scans
   - Enhanced database integration for storing scan results and measurements
   - Standardized prediction format for better database consistency

4. **Enhanced Visualization**:
   - Improved colormap application with better contrast and visibility
   - Added comprehensive medical description generation
   - Added detailed ROI measurement reporting

## System Improvements

1. **Database Integration**:
   - Identified schema structure through database inspection
   - Confirmed MRI-related tables and their relationships
   - Enhanced integration between MRI processing and database

2. **Patient Visit Comparison**:
   - Improved visualization of feature changes between patient visits
   - Added detection of clinically significant changes
   - Enhanced longitudinal analysis reporting

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Added cleanup script to remove temporary debugging files
   - Improved code structure with better separation of concerns
   - Fixed indentation and syntax errors

## Streamlit UI Enhancements

1. **MRI Visualization**:
   - Enhanced heatmap generation with more informative colormaps
   - Added comprehensive comparison between scans
   - Improved MRI scan management interface

2. **Patient Records**:
   - Added feature to compare records between visits 
   - Enhanced visualization of longitudinal changes
   - Improved report generation

## Next Steps

1. **Model Improvements**:
   - Continue collecting MRI data for model retraining
   - Enhance interpretability of MRI visualizations
   - Implement additional specialized models for different MRI types

2. **Feature Development**:
   - Implement automatic report generation for patient visits
   - Add medication management functionality
   - Develop predictive analytics for disease progression

3. **System Integration**:
   - Connect with external medical imaging systems
   - Implement secure data sharing between institutions
   - Add API for mobile app integration
